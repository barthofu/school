This is a simple native Android application written in Kotlin who's goal is to manage a list of the best Youtube videos. 

The user can add, edit and delete videos from the list. There's also a favorite system.

The application uses a Room SQLite database to store the videos and make use of Kotlin coroutines to perform asynchronous operations.
