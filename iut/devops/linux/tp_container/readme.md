# Containers

## Usage

1. Go in the `environment` folder
2. Run the command `sudo ./container`
3. A bash shell will start in the new isolated container, with 3 commands -> `kill`, `ls`, `ps`
4. You can exit the container at anytime by entering `exit` in the shell

## Setup

If you have problems, you can try to delete the `environment` folder, and re-run the `setup_env.sh` script
